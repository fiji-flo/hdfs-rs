//! hdfs-rs is a library for accessing to HDFS cluster.
//! Basically, this library provides libhdfs APIs bindings.
//! It also provides more idiomatic and abstract Rust APIs,
//! hiding manual memory management and some thread-safety problem of libhdfs.
//! Rust APIs are highly recommended for most users.
